## Status Meanings

| Badge | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ✓ (Green) | Perfect Match | All configured IPs match targets |
| ⚠ (Orange) | Partial Match | **DNS LEAK WARNING** - Only some IPs match |
| ✗ (Red) | Mismatch | None of your IPs match targets |
| ! (Gray) | Network Error | Cannot detect IP or no network |

## DNS Leak Detection

The extension warns you if:
- You configured both IPv4 and IPv6, but only one matches
- You configured one IP type, but the other is also active and doesn't match
- This indicates potential DNS leaks or VPN configuration issues

## Example Configurations

**Scenario 1: VPN with both IPv4 and IPv6**
- Target IPv4: `203.0.113.45`
- Target IPv6: `2001:db8::1`
- Result: Both must match for ✓ status

**Scenario 2: IPv4-only VPN**
- Target IPv4: `203.0.113.45`
- Target IPv6: Leave empty
- Result: Only IPv4 is checked

**Scenario 3: IPv6-only network**
- Target IPv4: Leave empty
- Target IPv6: `2001:db8::1`
- Result: Only IPv6 is checked

## Privacy

- This extension only checks your public IP addresses using ipify.org API
- No data is collected or transmitted except for the IP checks
- Target IPs are stored locally in your browser
- Checks both IPv4 and IPv6 for comprehensive monitoring

## Technical Details

- Uses ipify.org API for IPv4 detection
- Uses api64.ipify.org for IPv6 detection
- Both APIs are queried simultaneously
- Manifest V3 compatible
- Auto-check interval: 2 minutes
- Detects DNS leaks when only partial IP matches occur

## Troubleshooting

**"Network error" message**: Check your internet connection

**IP not updating**: Click "Check Now" to force an immediate check

**Badge not showing**: Ensure you've saved a target IP address
